# Flora
Flora is a prototype of an app for Indoor plant shopping. 




## Motivation behind a project
This project is made for an university assignment. Both participants enjoyed the idea of making an Indoor plant shop as an mobile application, therefore we made it.


## How to use it
Project is a prototype. It does not have a function to actually buy from an app.


## Platform and language used.
Android Studio, Kotlin


## Requirements
At this point, you only need Android Studio to run this application and see the existing functionalities. 


## What  to expect
* Flora has an opening page.
* Following that, it has a registration page. In which user can choose to either Log in, or Sign up. (Both those pages have their own pages)
* After that, user comes across a Catalog of existing plants, where they can choose their desired plants. (Each plant has its own page)
* Shopping cart page includes names of chosen plants with their individual prices.



## Credits
